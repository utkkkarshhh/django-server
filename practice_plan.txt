Here is a practice plan to help you master Django for interview purposes, based on your project structure.

### 1. Django ORM and Complex Queries

Your model structure is a great starting point for practicing complex queries. Here are some questions to guide you:

**Basic ORM Practice:**
- Get a list of all students.
- Get a list of all teachers.
- Get the details of a specific student by their ID.
- Filter students who are in a specific class.
- Filter students who have a specific parent.

**Advanced ORM Practice (Joins):**

Use `select_related` for foreign key and one-to-one relationships (forward and reverse).
- **Question 1:** Write a query to get all students and their respective classes. The query should be efficient and avoid the N+1 problem.
- **Question 2:** Get all `StudentParentMapping` entries and include the student and parent information in a single query.

Use `prefetch_related` for many-to-many and reverse foreign key relationships.
- **Question 3:** Write a query to get all students and list all the subjects they are enrolled in.
- **Question 4:** Write a query to get all teachers and list all the subjects they teach.
- **Question 5:** Find all parents and list their children (students).
- **Question 6:** For each class, get a list of all students in that class.

**Complex Filtering and Aggregation:**
- **Question 7:** Find all students who are enrolled in more than 3 subjects.
- **Question 8:** Find the teacher who teaches the maximum number of subjects.
- **Question 9:** Get a list of all parents who have more than one child in the school.
- **Question 10:** Calculate the number of students in each class.

### 2. Django Rest Framework (DRF)

You have a `serializers` directory, which is a good place to start.

- **Task 1:** Create serializers for all your models.
- **Task 2:** Create API endpoints (views) for the following:
    - A `ListView` to get all students.
    - A `DetailView` to get a single student's details, including their subjects and parents.
    - An endpoint to create a new student.
    - An endpoint to update a student's information.
- **Task 3:** Implement filtering and searching in your student list API. For example, allow filtering by class name or parent's name.
- **Task 4:** Implement pagination for the student list API.

### 3. Django Admin

- **Task 1:** Register all your models in `service/admin.py`.
- **Task 2:** Customize the admin interface. For `StudentAdmin`, display the class and subjects in the list view.
- **Task 3:** Add search fields to the admin for students, teachers, and parents.
- **Task 4:** Use `list_filter` to filter students by class.

### 4. Custom Management Commands

You have a `management/commands` directory.

- **Task 1:** You have `populate_school.py`. Enhance it to populate all the tables with realistic dummy data.
- **Task 2:** Write a new management command that takes a `student_id` and prints all the subjects the student is enrolled in.
- **Task 3:** Create a command to delete all data from the tables.

### 5. Django Settings and Configuration

- **Task 1:** You have a `.env.example` file. Explain the purpose of each variable in it.
- **Task 2:** In `django_server/settings.py`, you are likely using `decouple` or a similar library to load environment variables. Explain how it works.
- **Task 3:** Configure a database (like PostgreSQL) and explain the `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py`.

### 6. Docker and Deployment

You have a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Task 1:** Explain each line of the `Dockerfile`. What is its purpose?
- **Task 2:** Explain the `docker-compose.yml` file. What are the services defined in it?
- **Task 3:** Build and run the docker container.
- **Task 4:** How would you run migrations in a dockerized environment?

### 7. Cron Jobs

You have a `crons` directory.

- **Task 1:** Explain how the `manage_crons.py` command works.
- **Task 2:** Write a new cron job that runs every day and deactivates students who have not paid their fees (you might need to add a `fees_paid` field to the `Student` model).

### 8. Testing

You have a `service/tests.py` file.

- **Task 1:** Write unit tests for your models.
- **Task 2:** Write tests for your API endpoints. Test the list, detail, create, and update views.
- **Task 3:** Test the management commands you wrote.
